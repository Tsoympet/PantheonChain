# ParthenonChain Mobile Wallet Screenshots

This directory tracks the expected mobile wallet screenshot filenames for both iOS and Android.

## Expected Screenshots

- `home-ios.png`

## Repository Note

Binary screenshot files are intentionally **not committed** here because this contribution flow does not support binary file additions.

When final screenshots are captured, upload them through a binary-capable channel (release assets, docs CDN, or a standard Git workflow that supports binaries) and then reference them from docs.
