✅ P2P networking and mining  
✅ RPC server and CLI wallet  
✅ Hardware wallet integration (Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey)  
✅ GraphQL and WebSocket APIs  
✅ SPV light client support  
✅ Lightning-style payment channels  
✅ Cross-chain atomic swaps (HTLC)  
✅ Desktop wallet application (Qt-based)  
✅ Mobile wallet application (React Native)  
✅ Multi-signature wallet support
